# Eduverse - Online Learning Platform

Eduverse is an online learning platform that provides an array of courses from different subjects or categories. Users can browse through the list of courses and learn all the relevant information about a course, such as the instructor, skills theyâ€™ll get, and the list of units.

Users are welcome to register to become either learners or instructors, each of which grants different sets of actions on the website. Learners can enroll in courses or like and unlike courses. Instructors can add, edit, and delete courses.

Once users have logged in to an existing account in the database, they can access their profile/account page, which differs depending on their role. The Learner Account page features a list of courses the user has liked and enrolled in, including their enrollment date and status/progress in terms of completing the course. This enables learners to track their activities easily. Meanwhile, the Instructor Account page displays the list of courses they teach or add, including the options to edit and delete each course or add more courses. 

The website also features a News page, which displays several real-world news articles relevant to different categories in the education field, complete with a search and filter functionality.
